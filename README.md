# Aaron's Lovely Morning
![](https://moowool.info/aarons_beautiful_morning.png)
## Description
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game developed by [Moowool](https://moowool.info/) as a gift for [Aaron Franke](https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/aaronfranke/) using his custom [Node1D](https://github.com/aaronfranke/godot-1d) nodes.

To run the project, you will need a custom build of Godot v3.4-stable (or compatible) with the [Godot 1D](https://github.com/aaronfranke/godot-1d) extension compiled [custom.py](https://git.moowool.info/moowool/aarons-lovely-morning/src/branch/master/custom.py).
